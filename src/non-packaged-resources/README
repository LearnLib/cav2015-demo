Overview
============================================================================

LearnLib is a library for active automata learning algorithms. The current
version is written in Java and available as open source software under the 
LGPLv3 license. The CAV tool paper gives a short overview of more the more
recent work we have done on LearnLib for the open source release, and names
a number of recent works that use LearnLib. The paper also contains a 
proposal for a live demo as an appendix.

The reviewers requested data to back up claims we made about the performance
of LearnLib. So for the rebuttal we made this data available online and promised
to make it part of the paper for the final version. There is no final version
yet - we have included some performance results as a second appendix to the 
paper for this artifact evaluation. The artifact we submit contains three 
things:

1. The tool that is presented in the proposal for a live demo. This tool lets
   a user interact with a learning algorithm and shows the the internal data 
   structures as well as the produced models. We found that this kind of tool
   is very helpful when teaching automata learning to students. The demo 
   is described in Section 3. 

2. Scripts and programs that were used to produce the performance data. 
   In the paper we make claims about the performance of the new version of 
   LearnLib and compare it to other implementations of active automata learning
   (namely libalf and the old (closed-source) version of LearnLib). We performed
   experiments that are the basis for these claims. In Section 4 we describe 
   how the performance evaluation was set up can can be run.

3. A demo project that shows how to use LearnLib in your own project. LearnLib
   is a library and we are interested in growing an active user base. We aim 
   at making it easy to use the different algorithms and optimizations provided
   by LearnLib. We briefly describe the demo project in Section 5.

 Finally, Section 6 contains pointers to more documentation.


Installation
============================================================================

What you will find in this folder:

[TODO] describe contents of folder!!!

Remark: LearnLib uses maven (https://maven.apache.org/) as build environment.
(It is, however, not necessary to be familiar with maven for the evaluation of 
this artifact).

Performance Evaluation
============================================================================

[TODO] describe how to run things and what they do

[TODO] describe expected run times and how to shorten runtime

[TODO] describe outputs and how to read them 

[TODO] describe how plots can be created 


Source Demos
============================================================================

[TODO] describe where to find the source demo and what its scope is
